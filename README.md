# 📶 5G Energy Consumption Modeling – Machine Learning Challenge

## 🚀 Objective

This project focuses on solving a real-world problem presented by the **[International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx)** in 2023 as part of a global data science competition. The challenge, held from **July 5, 2023, to September 30, 2023**, aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of estimating **energy consumption in 5G base stations**, using network configuration, traffic, and energy-saving parameters.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Network **Operational Expenditure (OPEX)** is a significant burden on telecom operators, with **25% of total costs** attributed to operations and **90% of that to energy bills**. Alarmingly, **over 70%** of energy usage comes from the **Radio Access Network (RAN)**, especially the **base stations (BSs)**.

⚡ The goal: **Develop a machine learning regression model** to accurately **predict energy consumption** of 5G base stations, considering factors such as:

* Engineering configurations
* Traffic conditions
* Energy-saving features

## 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset is a **simplified version** of the original ITU dataset, designed for learning purposes. It includes:

* Cell-level traffic statistics
* Data from both **4G and 5G sites**
* Records collected across different days
